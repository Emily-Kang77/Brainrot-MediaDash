# MediaDash: Your Unified Entertainment Hub

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Integrates with YouTube, Spotify, IMDB, and more.
- **Smart Search**: Find content across all your subscriptions with a powerful search feature.
- **User Profiles**: Customize your experience with genre preferences and platform selections.
- **Content Rating**: Rate content out of 5 stars to improve future recommendations.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **AI/ML**: Langchain, Google's Gemini API
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend), TBD (Backend)
